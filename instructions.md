##Installing The New Theme##
1. Go to tumblr.com and sign in.
2. On the top right of the page, click the icon that looks like a person.
3. On the dropdown menu, click the name of your blog (probably will show up as welcometoseahaven).
4. On the page that pops up, click the link on the right side bar that says 'Edit Appearance'.
5. Click the 'Edit Theme' button that is in the middle section of this page.
6. You'll be brought to the Theme Editor page. Click the option on the left sidebar that says 'Edit HTML'.
7. Now without closing this window, go to the file I sent you, download and unzip it. Find the index.html file.
8. If you aren't familiar with opening html files in a text editor, right click the file and select 'Open With' and select either notepad (if you're using a PC) or textedit (if you're using a Mac). Once you open the index.html file in a text editor, copy all of the contents of this file.
9. Go back to the 'Edit HTML' page you were at on tumblr, clear out any pre existing HTML (if there is any) from here (you may want to save this into a text file just incase you need to go back to the original theme for any reason).
10. Paste the contents of index.html into the 'Edit HTML' section, click the 'Preview Changes' button. If the resulting preview looks right, click 'Save Changes'.
11. Press the back arrow button inside the 'Edit HTML' page to go back to the 'Edit Theme' Page.
12. Select your 'Merchandise' Page down below.
13. On the page that pops up, clear out the content you've posted (the links that say 'option 1, option 2, etc'). Save Changes.
14. Where it says 'Standard Layout' near the top of the page, click this and change it to Custom Layout.
15. Paste the contents of the merch.html file I sent you, very much the same way you did with the index.html file.
16. Preview and Save Changes if everything looks right. 

And you're done. You can continue to post to your blog as normal. I've included the theme assets to the file I sent you. You can host these on your page if you want, but you don't need to unless you want to alter the theme yourselves.

If you run into problems let me know, even if it's down the road. If you really want to use this and need help installing it let me know I can do that for you, but that would require giving me access to the tumblr account. I'd rather not have that information, but if you really need to you can create a temporary password for me to do that then switch if back after. But I think you'll be able to install it yourselves without issues.
